PROCEDURE:
NONE;3;
You are surrounded by a dizzying sequence of MOVE and COMPUTE statements. A large, dimly glowing sign points in four directions: WORKING-STORAGE, FILES, COMPILER, and EXIT.
INVALID;1;GO WORKING-STORAGE;5;GO FILES;9;GO COMPILER;47;GO EXIT;13;
WORKING-STORAGE:
NONE;7;
This space is immense, filled with perfectly organized shelves of data fields. Each shelf holds thousands of variables. In the center, an ancient, neglected console is blinking.
INVALID;5;GO PROCEDURE;1;GO FILES;9;EXAMINE CONSOLE;15;
FILES:
NONE;11;
A massive, dark vault where all the external data records are stored. You see a small, round object on the floor near a FILE DEFINITION, and a console right next to it.
INVALID;9;GO PROCEDURE;1;GO WORKING-STORAGE;5;EXAMINE OBJECT;37;EXAMINE CONSOLE;93;
There are two machines next to the exit door. One one each side. Each is blinking in anticipation of a card-like object.
INVALID;13;GO BACK;1;
*This variable will be used to hold the
NONE;17;
*selected customer's 6-digit balance.
NONE;19;
 01 WS-CUSTOMER-BALANCE  ___ ____.
NONE;21;

It seems you have to define the file type of the variable. What type of variable would be suitable here?
INVALID;15;GO BACK;7;HIDDEN;0;PIC 9(6);25;PIC 999999;25;
*This variable will be used to hold the
NONE;27;

 01 WS-CUSTOMER-BALANCE  PIC 9(6).
NONE;31;
 
NONE;33;
After defining the variable's file type, the console beeps once to hint at the validity of your solution.
NONE;35;
You see a piece of paper slowly coming out from below the console's screen. You take it and realize that it is a punch card.
INVALID;25;GO PROCEDURE;1;GO FILES;9;EXAMINE CONSOLE;15;
As you come closer to the object lying on the floor, you realize it is a period character. You pick it up and store it in your pocket.
INVALID;9;GO PROCEDURE;1;GO WORKING-STORAGE;5;EXAMINE CONSOLE;93;
You already examined the console.

A single, humming mainframe terminal displaying a perpetual error:

INVALID;67;GO PROCEDURE;1;USE PERIOD;87;
You insert the missing period and the error disappears. Relieved, you return to PROCEDURE.

FILES:
NONE;91;
A massive, dark vault where all the external data records are stored. There is a console in one of the corners.

There are two machines next to the exit door. One one each side. Each is blinking in anticipation of a card-like object. Maybe you have to insert two punch cards?

An audible click indicates the door is now unlocked. You are blinded by a bright light as you open it carefully.

The compiler seems to be throwing an error. You should probably take a look.
